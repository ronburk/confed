BIND
=======

The manual for (one version of) BIND is here:

https://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/cur/9.10/doc/arm/Bv9ARM.pdf

Comments are typical: //, /*, #

Quote:
A BIND 9 configuration consists of statements and comments.   Statements end with a semi-
colon.   Statements  and  comments  are  the  only  elements  that  can  appear  without  enclosing
braces.   Many statements contain a block of sub-statements,  which are also terminated with
a semicolon.
